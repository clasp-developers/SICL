;;; By SEGREGATING lexical locations, we mean taking each lexical
;;; location and turning it into either a dynamic lexical location
;;; (which can be allocated in a register or on the stack) or a
;;; static lexical location (which may or may not be possible to
;;; allocate on the stack, and might have to be allocated in some
;;; other place, possibly on the heap).
;;;
;;; The method used here is very simple, and not particularly
;;; sophisticated.  It assumes that every nested function can escape
;;; in arbitrary ways, so that every lexical location that is shared
;;; by some function F and some other function G nested inside F must
;;; be an static lexical location.
;;;
;;; LOCATION-OWNERS is an EQ hash table mapping each lexical location
;;; to its owner.
;;;
;;; We return a list of the lexical locations that have been
;;; categorized as static lexical locations.
