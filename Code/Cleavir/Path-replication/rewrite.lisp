;;; This rewrite rule is used as a preparation for moving INSTRUCTION
;;; past its predecessors, because in order to do that, INSTRUCTION
;;; must have a single predecessor.  This function replicates
;;; INSTRUCTION for each predecessor P.  It does that by creating a
;;; replica RP of INSTRUCTION, then it replaces INSTRUCTION with RP in
;;; the successors of P.  Finally, it replaces INSTRUCTION by all the
;;; RPs in each successor of INSTRUCTION.
;;;
;;; We return a list of the copies that were created.
;;;
;;; Notice that we do NOT update the defining and using instructions
;;; of the inputs and outputs of INSTRUCTION.  After this rewrite has
;;; been accomplished, this information must be updated explicitly if
;;; required.
