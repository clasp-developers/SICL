\section{Previous work}

Most implementations process list elements in reverse order when
\texttt{:from-end} is true only when the specification requires it,
i.e., only for the functions \texttt{count} and \texttt{reduce}.

We designed a technique \cite{Durand:2015:ELS:reverse} that allows us
to always process list elements in reverse order very efficiently when
\texttt{:from-end} is true.
